cat /proc/cpuinfo         # Provides detailed information about each CPU core
top                       # Real-time view of CPU usage by processes

ps aux                    # Lists all running processes with full details
top                       # Real-time process and resource monitor (CPU, memory, etc.)
htop                      # Interactive process viewer (scrollable and filterable, if installed)
kill PID                  # Terminates a process by its PID (replace PID with actual process ID)
